# Raveling_detection
Image Classification Problem: 
The assignment is on image classification problem using shallow supervised machine learning algorithms (logistic regression or artificial neural networks). 
The dataset consists of images of pavements with or without raveling distress. 
The objective is to develop a binary image classification model that can classify the images based on the presence of raveling distress.
